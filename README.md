### Basic Usage

1. IntelliText will create a it_macros.json file in `~/.intellitext/` you can edit it to your liking:

```json
{
    "macros": {
        "word": {
            "!hello": "Hello World!",
            "!greet": "Hi there,How are you?,Hello friend!",
            "!sig": "Best regards,\nYour Name"
        },
        "action": {
            "#cb": "",
            "#rnp": "notepad.exe"
        }
    },
    "macro_settings": {
        "shuffle": {
            "enabled": true,
            "shuffle_macros": ["!greet"]
        },
        "extension_setting": {
            "enabled": true,
            "extensions": []
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run from Terminal:
```cmd
intellitext.py
```


3. Run IntelliText in Python:

```python
from intellitext import IntelliText

intellitext = IntelliText()
intellitext.run()
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Word Macros
- Type `!` followed by your macro name
- Example: `!hello` expands to "Hello, World!"
- For multiple variants, separate with commas in the config
- Enable shuffle in settings to randomize between variants

### Action Macros
- `#cb` - Paste clipboard content
- `#r[program]` - Run a program `#rvsc` (Run vscode)
- `#ite` - Exit IntelliText
- Custom actions can be added in the config

## üîé Extensions
An Extension will only run when the macro starts with @ and ends with $

```json
{
    "extension_setting": {
        "enabled": true,
        "extensions": [
            {
                "@date": "date_formatter.py",
                "type": "print",
                "cmd": "python",
                "args": ["--format", "yyyy-MM-dd"]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

For example:
`@date$` 

This will run the date extension with the predefined arguments in the it_macros.json file.

The argument priority is with the inline args passed to the extension when typing the macro.

This means that this macro: `@date --format yy-mm-dd$` 
will run with the arguments passed to the macro, and not the ones defined in the `it_macros.json`


In this case, `@date` is what triggers the extension.
The value of `@date` is the script or program that will run.
IntelliText will try to look for the script/program name in the `~/.intellitext/extensions` folder,
if it's not found there, it will try to use at as in absolute path.
The extension will not run if the file is not found.
